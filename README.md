# ZarmBot
## Discord Bot
## Currently under development
Current scaling of bot capability underway.
Previously used for research into some possibilities of the bots functions, now being developed into a full fledged distributable bot.
Adding some small scaling capability to support more servers, SQLite is being added on SQLite branch for hard storage and better access
to data used by the bot.
Limitations of SQLite are understood and further implementations will address this.

Branch - sqlite

## Future Implementations
- Fullscale MYSQL database
- Better hosting
- Apache/XAMPP
